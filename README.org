Extensions for [[https://github.com/eshelyaron/kubed][kubed]] that add k9s-style metrics, port-forward management,
terminal integration, Strimzi operations, CRD auto-discovery, and more —
all from within Emacs.  Zero external Emacs dependencies beyond kubed and transient.

* Features

** 🚀 Core Features
- *Async Metrics* — Non-blocking =kubectl top= using native Emacs process sentinels (no external async library)
- *Advanced Port Forwarding* — Auto-complete ports from container/service specs, management buffer, visual row markers
- *CRD Auto-Discovery* — Automatically fetch =additionalPrinterColumns= from CRDs and inject them into list views
- *Server-Side Filtering* — Label selector support (=--selector=) with auto-completion from live cluster labels
- *Substring Filter with Highlight* — Kubel-style =/filter/= with =M-n= / =M-p= to jump between matches; non-matching rows dimmed
- *Mark / Unmark System* — Select items with =*= (like Dired), mark all, unmark all, batch delete or batch logs on marked items
- *Error Overlay Header* — kubectl stderr appears as a red banner at the top of list buffers, just like kubel
- *Strimzi Kafka Support* — Pause/resume reconciliation, restart connectors, scale KafkaConnect, set topic partitions
- *Enhanced Resource Views* — Extended columns for pods, services, ingresses, PVs, nodes, and more
- *Terminal Integration* — Open vterm, eat, eshell, or ansi-term directly into pods via =kubectl exec=
- *Rollout Management* — View history, inspect revisions, undo rollouts for deployments/statefulsets/daemonsets
- *Jab (Bounce) Deployments* — Force rolling restart by patching a timestamp label
- *initContainer Logs* — Tail logs from init containers with auto-discovery
- *Logs by Label Selector* — Stream logs from all pods matching a label expression
- *Output Format Toggle* — Switch between YAML and JSON for resource display buffers
- *Wide View* — Show =kubectl get -o wide= output in a dedicated buffer
- *Customizable Status Faces* — =kubed-ext-status-faces= alist maps status strings to faces (like kubel)
- *Command Logging* — Track all kubectl commands in a dedicated log buffer
- *Dynamic Transient Menu* — Context-aware transient (=?=) with navigation, actions, and utilities
- *Clipboard Operations* — Copy resource names, YAML, log commands, kubectl prefixes

* Detailed Feature Guide

** Pod Status Computation

Pods use a kubel-style status computation.  Instead of showing the raw
=.status.phase=, kubed-ext examines:

1. =.metadata.deletionTimestamp= — if set, status is "Terminating"
2. =.status.containerStatuses[*].state.waiting.reason= — shows waiting reason (e.g., "ContainerCreating", "CrashLoopBackOff")
3. =.status.containerStatuses[*].state.terminated.reason= — shows terminated reason (e.g., "OOMKilled", "Error")
4. =.status.phase= — fallback (e.g., "Running", "Succeeded", "Pending")

The Ready column shows =x/y= format (ready containers / total containers)
with green/yellow/red coloring.  Restarts are color-coded: 0 is plain,
1–4 yellow, 5+ red.

#+begin_quote
*Important*: kubectl returns =<none>= for missing fields.  kubed-ext
correctly handles =<none>= in all format functions and status computation.
Earlier versions had a bug where =<none>= in =deletionTimestamp= caused
all pods to show "Terminating".
#+end_quote

** Customizable Status Faces

The variable =kubed-ext-status-faces= is an alist mapping status strings
to Emacs faces.  Customize it to change colors:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Make "Pending" red instead of yellow
(setf (alist-get "Pending" kubed-ext-status-faces nil nil #'string=) 'error)

;; Add a custom status
(push '("Init:0/1" . warning) kubed-ext-status-faces)
#+end_src

Default mappings:
| Status                       | Face                     |
|------------------------------+--------------------------|
| Running                      | =success= (green)       |
| Succeeded                    | =shadow= (dim)          |
| Completed                    | yellow foreground        |
| Pending, ContainerCreating   | =warning= (yellow)      |
| Terminating                  | blue foreground          |
| Failed, Error, OOMKilled     | =error= (red)           |
| CrashLoopBackOff             | =error= (red)           |
| ImagePullBackOff, ErrImagePull | =error= (red)          |

** Substring Filter with Highlight

Press =f= in any list buffer to set a substring filter.  Non-matching rows
are dimmed with the =shadow= face.  Navigate between matches:

- =M-n= — jump to next matching row (wraps around)
- =M-p= — jump to previous matching row (wraps around)

The active filter appears in the mode line as =/filter/=.  Press =f= and
enter an empty string to clear the filter.

This is separate from kubed's built-in S-expression filter (=/=), which
hides non-matching rows entirely.  The substring filter only dims them,
so you can still see the full list.

** Mark / Unmark System

Like Dired, you can select individual items for batch operations:

| Key   | Action                              |
|-------+-------------------------------------|
| =m=   | Mark current item with =*=          |
| =u=   | Unmark current item (from kubed)    |
| =M-m= | Mark all visible items              |
| =M-u= | Unmark all items                    |
| =X=   | Delete all =*= marked items         |

Marked items display a =*= tag in the first column, styled with the
=dired-marked= face.  The existing kubed =d= / =D= marks (for deletion)
are preserved and work independently.

** Error Overlay Header

When a =kubectl get= command fails (exit code 1), kubed-ext displays a
red error banner at the top of the affected list buffer, showing the
stderr output.  The banner persists across buffer reverts until the
next successful update clears it.

This is implemented as an overlay with high priority, similar to kubel's
=kubel--set-header-error=.

** Async Metrics (Top)

Metrics are fetched asynchronously using native Emacs process sentinels.
Two kubectl commands run concurrently (=top= and =get= for allocatable/limits),
and the table populates when both complete.  The UI remains responsive during fetches.

Node top shows: Name, CPU used, CPU allocatable, %CPU, MEM used, MEM allocatable, %MEM.

Pod top shows: Name, CPU, MEM, CPU request, CPU limit, %CPU/request, %CPU/limit,
MEM request, MEM limit, %MEM/request, %MEM/limit.

Percentage columns are color-coded: green (<70%), yellow (70–90%), red (>90%).

Per-node action (=T= on a specific node) shows a single-node summary with
CPU and MEM usage vs allocatable.

** Port Forwarding

Port-forward commands auto-discover available ports:
- For pods: reads =.spec.containers[*].ports[*]=
- For services: reads =.spec.ports[*]=
- For deployments: reads =.spec.template.spec.containers[*].ports[*]=

Completion candidates show port number, name, and protocol.

Active port-forwards are highlighted with a green background in list buffers.
The port-forwards management buffer (=kubed-ext-list-port-forwards=) shows
all active forwards with resource, ports, namespace, context, and status.

** CRD Auto-Discovery

On first listing of any resource type, kubed-ext checks if the resource has a CRD
with =additionalPrinterColumns=.  If found, those columns are injected into the
tabulated-list view automatically.  The =Age= column is filtered out (kubed handles
timestamps separately).

Force re-discovery after deploying new CRDs:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x kubed-ext-refresh-crd-columns
#+end_src

** Server-Side Label Selectors

Press =S= in any list buffer to set a =--selector= that is injected into the
kubectl =get= command server-side.  This is more efficient than client-side filtering
for large clusters.

Labels are auto-discovered from existing resources with 60-second caching.
The active selector appears in the mode line as ={selector}=.

** initContainer Logs

Press =i= on a pod in the list buffer, or use =M-x kubed-ext-logs-init-container=.
kubed-ext discovers init containers via =.spec.initContainers[*].name=.  If there
is only one init container, it is selected automatically; otherwise you are prompted.

** Logs by Label Selector

Use =C-c k L= (or =M-x kubed-ext-logs-by-label=) to stream logs from all pods
matching a label selector.  Labels are auto-discovered from the cluster.  You are
prompted for the number of tail lines (default 100).

** Output Format Toggle

=M-x kubed-ext-set-output-format= prompts for =yaml= or =json=.
=M-x kubed-ext-toggle-output-format= switches between them.
The setting affects resource display buffers (=kubed-display-resource= and friends).

** Wide View

Press =W= in any list buffer to open a new buffer showing =kubectl get -o wide=
output for the current resource type, namespace, and context.

** Strimzi Kafka Operations

In Kafka/KafkaConnect list buffers:
- =P= — Pause reconciliation (annotates =strimzi.io/pause-reconciliation=true=)
- =R= — Resume reconciliation (removes the annotation)

In KafkaConnect list buffers:
- =$= — Scale replicas

In KafkaConnector list buffers:
- =P= — Pause connector (patches =spec.pause=true=)
- =R= — Resume connector (patches =spec.pause=false=)
- =X= — Restart connector (annotates =strimzi.io/restart=true=)

In KafkaTopic list buffers:
- =p= — Set partition count

** Terminal Integration

| Method    | Key | How it works                      | Requires      |
|-----------+-----+-----------------------------------+---------------|
| vterm     | =v= | Direct =kubectl exec= via vterm   | =vterm=       |
| eat       | =t= | Direct =kubectl exec= via eat     | =eat=         |
| eshell    | =E= | TRAMP-based (=kubed-tramp=)       | =kubed-tramp= |
| ansi-term | =A= | Spawns bash, sends exec command   | built-in      |
| shell-cmd | =&= | Prompts for command, runs via exec | built-in      |

Terminal commands use direct =kubectl exec= (no TRAMP overhead for vterm/eat).
The shell can be customized:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq kubed-ext-pod-shell "/bin/bash")
#+end_src

** Dynamic Transient Menu

Press =?= in any list buffer to open a context-aware transient:

- *Navigate* — Switch context, namespace, resource type
- *Jump* — Quick jump to pods, deployments, services, jobs, configmaps, secrets, ingresses, PVCs
- *Actions* — Resource-specific actions (port-forward, rollout, top, terminals, init logs) pulled from both upstream kubed suffixes and kubed-ext additions
- *General* — Refresh, describe, filter (S-expr and substring), label selector, wide view, quit
- *Utilities* — Switch buffer, copy name, copy menu, command log, mark items, delete marked

Outside of list buffers, =?= shows a simpler resource picker.

* Configuration

** Customization Options

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Shell for pod terminals (default: "/bin/sh")
(setq kubed-ext-pod-shell "/bin/bash")

;; Output format for display buffers (default: "yaml")
(setq kubed-ext-output-format "json")

;; kubectl binary (inherited from kubed)
(setq kubed-kubectl-program "/usr/local/bin/kubectl")

;; Customize status colors
(setf (alist-get "Running" kubed-ext-status-faces nil nil #'string=) 'bold)
(push '("Degraded" . error) kubed-ext-status-faces)

;; Port-forward highlight face
(custom-set-faces
 '(kubed-ext-port-forward-face
   ((((background dark)) :background "#2a3a2a")
    (((background light)) :background "#d8f5d8"))))
#+end_src

** Display Behavior

Kubed list buffers and top buffers open in the same window by default
(configured via =display-buffer-alist=).

* Troubleshooting

** All pods show "Terminating"
This was a bug in earlier versions of kubed-ext.  The =<none>= value
returned by kubectl for empty fields was not recognized, causing
=.metadata.deletionTimestamp= to appear non-empty for every pod.

*Fix*: Update to the latest version.  The =kubed-ext-none-p= utility
function now correctly handles =nil=, empty string, =<none>=, and
=<unknown>=.

** Metrics not showing
Ensure metrics-server is installed in your cluster:
#+begin_src bash
kubectl top nodes  # Test from command line first
#+end_src

If the top buffer shows "Fetching metrics..." and never populates, check
=*Messages*= for error output.

** CRD columns not appearing
Manually refresh the CRD cache:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x kubed-ext-refresh-crd-columns
#+end_src

Then re-open the list buffer.  CRD discovery only runs once per resource
type + context pair.

** Port-forward fails
Check:
1. Resource exists: =kubectl get <type> <name> -n <ns>=
2. Port is available locally: =lsof -i :<port>=
3. Context/namespace are correct (check mode line)

** Terminal won't connect
- vterm/eat: ensure the package is installed (=M-x package-install RET vterm=)
- eshell: requires =kubed-tramp= (bundled with kubed)
- Check that the pod has a shell (=/bin/sh= or =/bin/bash=)

** Label selector not filtering
The selector is injected via advice on =kubed-update=.  If another package
also advises =make-process=, there may be conflicts.  Check =*Messages*= for errors.

** Error banner stuck at top of buffer
The error overlay clears automatically on the next successful =kubectl get=.
If it persists, press =g= to force a refresh.

* Contributing

Contributions welcome!  Please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (=git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature=)
3. Commit your changes (=git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'=)
4. Push to the branch (=git push origin feature/amazing-feature=)
5. Open a Pull Request

** Development Guidelines
- Follow Emacs Lisp conventions (lexical binding, proper docstrings)
- Use =kubed-ext-= prefix for public functions/variables
- Use =kubed-ext--= (double dash) for internal functions
- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Handle =<none>= values via =kubed-ext-none-p= in all format functions
- Wrap external process calls in =condition-case= where appropriate
- Test with multiple Kubernetes contexts and namespaces
- Ensure no byte-compilation warnings
